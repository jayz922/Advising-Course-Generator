# CS300-Data-Structures-Algorithms
Folder with final project of CS300 and various other projects related to Vectors, hashTable, BinaryTrees

 What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course, all of the problems and projects were related to data structures and algorithms. We learned to basically use vectors, hashTables, and BinaryTrees to solve projects and retrieve desired output of a program given the requirements. There was a methodical way to approach each project which started with pseudocode and then finally, the code itself.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are so important to understand?

Zybooks was a great help in learning the basics of each data structure and algorithm. When given a problem, using pseudocode or a flowchart to map out the functions of the program is a great help. Using pseudocode, I was able to translate it into the code with the right syntax seamlessly and successfuly solve the given problem.

 How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

When I was faced with challenges, I used websites like geeksforgeeks, stackoverflow and tutorialspoint to read more about c++ syntax and understand what I was doing wrong. After writing a few lines of code, I would build the program to make sure that I was writing correct code using proper syntax. This helped me keep track of bugs and resolve them rather than having a lot of issues at the end of coding the project. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to desigining software and developing programs?

This project was very interesting and involved because there was no template given to code within like some of the prior projects in the class. It required me to be analytical and learn to break down different aspects of the program to work on piece by piece. Also I understood that writing good pseudocode can be pivotal in creating a successful program. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Writing maintanable, readable and adaptable code is something that has been taught since the beginning of this degree. For me to actually constantly think about these things while I program has been helpful in growing as a developer. Everytime I solve an issue in the code, I want it to be an efficient solution but also thorough enough that someone that makes changes/additions to my initial commit can follow along with my thought process.
